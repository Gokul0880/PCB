# PCB Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various PCB designs created using KiCad as part of my learning journey. The projects include different types of power converters, sensor modules, and other embedded system circuits.

## Included Designs
- **Buck Converter** - Step-down DC-DC converter
- **Boost Converter** - Step-up DC-DC converter
- **Linear Regulators** - Voltage regulation circuits
- **Power Management Circuits** - Various power distribution designs
- **Sensor Modules** - PCB layouts for different sensors

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-pcb-repo.git
   ```
2. Open the project in KiCad:
   - Open KiCad and load the required `.pro` file.
   - Access the schematic editor and PCB layout as needed.
3. Generate Gerber files for manufacturing:
   - Use KiCad's "Plot" function to export Gerber files.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)
Each project folder contains a BOM listing all components used in the design.
